Binary Search is a search algorithm used to search a particular data from a list of data. Since the efficiency of linear search is poor, binary search came as a better option but the prerequisite of binary search is that the array should be in a sorted manner. Since the array is sorted, we just compare the element to be found with the middle element of array, if data is not found there we break our array into 2 parts accordingly whether the number to be found is greater or less than the middle element & this process continues until we find the data !
